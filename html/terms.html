<h2>1. OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU</h2>
<p>1.1
These are the terms on which we will carry out the work for you. Please ensure that you read them carefully before asking our engineer to begin the work. We have highlighted those terms that you should pay particular attention to.</p>

<p>1.2
When you telephone us, we will take details of the work you need us to carry out, your credit or debit card details and will arrange a time slot for an engineer to visit you. Please note that we reserve the right to refuse to accept certain credit and debit cards.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. CARRYING OUT THE JOB</h2>
<p>2.1
We will supply you with a date and time when we will arrive to begin carrying out the work. We will give you an estimate of how long the work will take to complete, however, this will only be an estimate and the work may take more or less time than we have anticipated.</p>

<p>2.2
We will try to get to you as soon as possible and where possible before the time slot we have allocated to you, if, when we book the job we consider the circumstances you have described to us are an emergency. However, this might not be possible if an event occurs which is outside of our control (see below).</p>

<p>2.3
We will make every effort to arrive and to complete the work on time. However, we will not be liable or responsible for any delay or failure to carry out the work, due to an event outside our control such as poor traffic conditions, poor weather conditions or the failure of public or private telecommunications networks. If such an event happens, we will let you know as soon as possible and you can cancel the job if you no longer want us to carry out the work. We may cancel the job if the event lasts for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>2.4
To enable us to carry out the work you will need to:
<br>
Provide us with access to the premises and any services and facilities we need to carry out the work;
Ensure that the premises are clear and safe for us to access and that you own the premises and do not need the consent of another person to enable us to carry out the work;
Ensure that any materials you provide to enable us to carry out the work are suitable. If you fail to do so we may not be able to carry out the work and you may need to contact us to arrange a further visit.</p>
<p>2.5
When our engineer has completed the job he will complete a job sheet (Job Sheet) and will provide a copy to you. This will include the time he arrived at the premises, the work carried out, the time that the work was completed and the price to be paid by you. You will be asked to sign the Job Sheet to confirm that this information is correct. If you think that any of the information listed on the Job Sheet is inaccurate, please telephone us on 07510 843296 or write to us at BD Plumbing,61,Roe Drive,Norwich,Norfolk,NR5 8BT or email: info@bdplumbing.co.uk. We shall assign a Job Number to the job which will be written on the Job Sheet. Please quote the Job Number in all subsequent correspondence with us relating to the job.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>3. PRICE AND PAYMENT</h2>
<p>3.1
The price you pay will include a charge for labour, parts and materials and VAT.</p>

<p>3.1.1
For jobs booked on an hourly or half-hourly rate, labour will be charged from the moment that our engineer arrives at your premises at the hourly or half-hourly rate quotes and specified on the Job Sheet. For example if our engineer is at your premises for 45 minutes and charges £80 per hour, we will charge you £80 for the work. Please note that we will charge for any time spent by our engineer diagnosing the work to be carried out.</p>

<p>3.1.2
For jobs booked on a fixed price, you will be charged from the moment that our engineer arrives at your premises at the fixed price quoted and specified on the Job Sheet. For example if we have told you that we will charge you a fixed price of £80 for the labour, we will charge you £80 for the labour, plus the cost of any parts that may be required. Some fixed price jobs also includes the cost for parts, which we will confirm when you book the job.</p>

<!----<p>3.1.3
For jobs booked on a fixed price basis with a Care Club care plan attached, you will be charged from the moment that our engineer arrives at your premises at the fixed price specified on the Job Sheet. For example if we have told you that we will charge you a fixed price of £80 for the labour, we will charge you £80 for the labour, plus the cost of any parts that may be required. Some fixed price jobs also includes the cost for parts, which we will confirm when you book the job. You will then pay us for a care plan, which forms part of the job. The attached care plan may be paid for monthly or annually by direct debit. (The care plan product has its own Terms and Conditions and these will be sent separately when you book the job). For the avoidance of doubt, the total cost of the job will include the labour and annual care plan.</p>-->
